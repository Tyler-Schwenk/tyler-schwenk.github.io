						I earned my <span style="color: hsl(18, 68%, 48%)">B.S. in Computer Science</span> with a Sustainability minor from San Diego State University. 
						During that time I gained additional experience working with my peers as a math and computer science <span style="color: hsl(18, 68%, 48%)">tutor</span>.
						Joining clubs allowed me to develop projects including a Natural Language Processing ML model, and a ML object detection model

											<h3>Sustainability & Farm Work</h3>
										</header>
										<p>My first two years in SDSU I started as an environmental engineering major, which taught me a lot about the necessity
											to protect our planet. After switching to computer science I became interested in applying my skillset towards developing
											 sustainable energy solutions, which led me to the sustainability minor. Because of the interdisiplinary nature of this 
											 department, I have been able to study sustainability in many contexts such as biology, anthropology and computing.
										</p>
										<p>I was able to apply what I learned in the summer of 2022 when I worked on a no-till organic farm in Washington. I participated in start-up 
											operations such as preparing large beds, starting seeds, and creating compost. This gave me a good understanding of how to create a 
											project to be sustainable from the ground up.

										</header>
										<p>I became part of the Gardening committee for SDSU green love starting in spring 2021, involved in taking care of two 
											garden plots as well as working with a local church in planning their new community garden. In spring 2023 I also 
											joined the Environmental Justice committee to learn more about what I can do to prevent degredation.

											<h3>Gardening at Home</h3>
										</header>
										<p>While studying sustainability in school, I quickly learned that a great way to reduce your impact and learn about sustainability 
											was to simply start a garden at your own home. For that reason I built a few raised beds at home and have been growing some native flowers
											 and vegtables that I enjoy cooking.

										</header>
										<p>Upon arriving at SDSU I joined the climbing club, and became the community outreach coordinator the next semester
											. I became the president for 2020 and was much more involved in planning and managing weekend-long rock climbing
											 expeditions to places such as Joshua Tree; CA, Red Rocks; NV, and Yosemite; CA. At the time the club had over 130 members
											and I worked with my other board members to manage money from dues and maintain safety on these trips.

										</header>
										<p>Since I joined the Philadelphia Rock Gym's climbing team in 2008 I have competed in many competitions
											including two Youth, and one Collegiate National Championships through USA Climbing. Outside of competitions, I have 
											been climbing and mountaineering outdoors in many different locations across the country, learning the responsibility necessary to stay
											 safe in such dangerous situations. This involves both a solid understanding of technical skills like anchor building, route finding and rope
											  management as well as intuition and knowledge of how to plan and pack for trips and knowing when to retreat if the mountain tells you to.
